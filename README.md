1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Install dependencies:

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_for_testing
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

### 4. Development Mode
For faster command testing in a specific server:
1. Set `NODE_ENV=development` in your `.env`

### Troubleshooting

**Commands not appearing?**
- Deployment runs automatically, but if commands are missing you can run `node deploy-commands.js`
- Check that your bot has the required permissions
- Global commands can take up to 1 hour to appear

**Bot not responding?**
- Verify your bot token is correct
- Ensure the bot is online (check Discord)
- Check console for error messages

**Permission errors?**
- Verify bot has `Send Messages` and `Use Slash Commands` permissions
- Make sure the bot role is above any role restrictions

### Environment Variables

- `OWNER_FALLBACK_ON_CHANNEL_FAIL`: When set to `true`, if a guildâ€™s log delivery mode is set to `channel` and sending to the configured channel fails (missing/not set/inaccessible), the bot will fall back to DMing bot owners. When unset or `false`, no owner-DM fallback occurs in `channel` mode. Applies to both moderation and security logs.
