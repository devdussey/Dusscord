### Environment Variables

- `OWNER_FALLBACK_ON_CHANNEL_FAIL`: When set to `true`, if a guildâ€™s log delivery mode is set to `channel` and sending to the configured channel fails (missing/not set/inaccessible), the bot will fall back to DMing bot owners. When unset or `false`, no owner-DM fallback occurs in `channel` mode. Applies to both moderation and security logs.
- `BOT_OWNER_IDS`: Space or comma separated list of bot owner user IDs. Takes precedence over `BOT_OWNER_ID` when both are set.
- `BOT_OWNER_ID`: Single bot owner user ID used if `BOT_OWNER_IDS` is unset.
